# PolicyGuard: Insurance Churn Prediction System
The PolicyGuard system is an intelligent insurance churn prediction platform designed to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their insurance policies. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a user-friendly web interface, the system enables insurance companies to take proactive retention actions and improve long-term customer engagement

## About
PolicyGuard: Insurance Churn Prediction System is a data-driven solution that applies machine learning models to analyze historical insurance customer data and predict churn behavior. In the competitive insurance market, retaining existing customers is crucial, yet traditional churn identification methods rely on manual analysis and basic statistical approaches that often lack accuracy and timeliness.

This project addresses these challenges by integrating machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression to identify churn patterns based on customer demographics, policy details, payment history, and claim behavior. The system provides an interactive web interface where users can upload datasets, view churn predictions, analyze insights through dashboards, and receive actionable recommendations. By automating churn prediction, PolicyGuard helps insurance organizations reduce revenue loss and enhance customer retention strategies.

## Features
- Machine learning–based churn prediction using Random Forest and Logistic Regression

- Web-based application for easy data upload and result visualization

- Interactive dashboard with churn statistics and probability analysis

- Actionable recommendations for customer retention

- Scalable and modular system architecture

- Secure handling of data and API credentials

## Requirements
- Operating System:
Requires a 64-bit operating system such as Windows 10 or Ubuntu for compatibility.

- Development Environment:
Python 3.8 or later for backend development and model execution.

- Machine Learning Libraries:
Scikit-learn for model training and prediction, Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing.

- Web Framework:
Flask for backend server development and API handling.

- Frontend Technologies:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building responsive user interfaces.

- Database / Storage:
Google Sheets or CSV-based storage for managing customer datasets.

IDE & Tools:
VS Code for coding, debugging, and project management; Git for version control.

## System Architecture

The system architecture follows a client–server model where users interact through a web interface to upload insurance customer data. The Flask backend processes the data, applies preprocessing techniques, and sends it to the trained machine learning models. Prediction results are then returned to the dashboard for visualization and analysis. An AI chatbot module optionally assists users by explaining churn predictions and providing insights.

## Output

### Output – Home Page

The Home Page serves as the entry point of the PolicyGuard system. It provides a clear overview of the application and guides users to begin the churn prediction process. The “Start Prediction” option allows users to navigate easily to the data upload section, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
